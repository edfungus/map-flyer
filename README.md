A tech demo of using machine to machine MQTT protocol to connect any two devices and transfer aceelerometer data. As a result, you can navigate Google Maps on your computer with your phone's accelerometer. If your computer also has an accelerometer, the reverse will work too!

Thanks to these libraries!
